<h1>Main characters</h1>
<h3>Ichigo Kurosaki</h3>
<img src ="ichigo.png" height='18%' width='15%' alt="ichigo kurosaki">
<p>Ichigo Kurosaki (黒崎 一護, Kurosaki Ichigo) is the main protagonist of the series. A tall orange-haired high school student, Ichigo becomes a "substitute Soul Reaper" after unintentionally absorbing most of Rukia Kuchiki's powers. His cynical nature at first makes him ill-disposed towards the duty, but, with the passage of time, he accepts and welcomes the strength his Soul Reaper powers give him.[8] When creating the manga series, Kubo commented that Rukia Kuchiki, the first character he created, did not seem like a lead character, so he created Ichigo to be the series protagonist.

<h3>Rukia Kuchiki</h3>

<p>
Rukia Kuchiki (朽木 ルキア, Kuchiki Rukia) is a Soul Reaper,(死神, Shinigami, literally 'Death God'), who is assigned hollow extermination duties in Karakura Town. She meets Ichigo for the first time when she breaks into his house, not knowing that he can see her. Their relationship further complicates when Rukia saves Ichigo and transfers her powers to him. Rukia lacks it and cannot return to the Soul Society. She assumes a temporary lifestyle as a regular human, using a gigai (human form) obtained from Kisuke Urahara's shop, and enrolls into Ichigo's high school and takes up residence in his closet, while teaching him how to be a substitute Soul Reaper in her place.[8] Rukia was the first female character of the series created by Kubo, her design being the one he decided to use for all the other Soul Reapers.

<h3>Orihime Inoue</h3>

<p>Orihime Inoue (井上 織姫, Inoue Orihime) is a long-time classmate of Ichigo and one of his closest friends. She used to have a crush on Ichigo since the beginning, however due to Ichigo's selfless wish to protect his loved ones, Orihime genuinely falls in love with him. Since the age of three, she had been an orphan when her older brother Sora left their abusive parents' home with her and raised Orihime on his own. Later on, when Orihime was in middle school, Sora died in an accident.[11] Though initially devoid of spiritual powers, she develops spiritual awareness early in the plot. She later obtains the god-like ability to warp reality through rejecting past phenomena.

<h3>Uryu Ishida</h3>

<p>Uryū Ishida (石田 雨竜, Ishida Uryū)[n 1] is a Quincy, a descendant of a line of near-extinct, priest-like, hollow-hunting archers, who were historical enemies of the Soul Reapers. He bears a deep grudge against all Soul Reapers, including Ichigo, and is an early antagonist in the series.[16] He comes to view Ichigo differently over time, and eventually becomes a valuable ally and a friendly rival. As a Quincy, Uryū possesses the supernatural power to gather invisible "spirit particles" called reishi from the atmosphere. Once gathered, these particles can be shaped into spirit-energy constructs, foremost among them a bow and arrow,[17] and to fuel various magical spells and superhuman abilities.
</p>
<h3>Byakuya Kuchiki</h3>

<p>Byakuya Kuchiki (朽木 白哉, Kuchiki Byakuya) is Rukia's older brother. He is a captain of Squad Six, with the purpose of capturing his sister and executing her in Soul Society, but he and his lieutenant Renji Abarai are forced to face the replacement shinigami Ichigo Kurosaki, before taking her away. Byakuya is a representative of Clan Kuchiki and proved to be a fair aristocrat who does not get carried away by emotions, as he did not care about the execution of his own sister, even confronting Renji and Ichigo for trying to save her. But currently they have returned as allies, even though Byakuya is reluctant because of his enmity with Ichigo.
